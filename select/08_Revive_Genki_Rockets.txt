Broken wings, we are trying to break free
Broken pieces scattered everywhere
Look deep inside, We're all the same
We're in a circle, eternal dream

Hear me sing, shiny dream
Shuttle by, revive
Do you feel what I feel, you and I connect
Energy, glowing lights???? revive
Every move, every thought
We will synchronize
Follow my heart beat, hang on to my dream

Silent wind, flowing through the smoky air
Overlapping shadows everywhere
It's time to change, nothing is real
No one can stop us, their energy

I dont want anymore
Simplify, revive
Can you see what I see
Something far away
Memories glowing bright
Sacrifice, revive
Future time, future lives
Relive everything
Follow my heartbeat, hang on to our dream
Hang on to our dream

With all these pieces broken inside us
Follow the light

Hear me sing, shiny dream
Shuttle by, revive
Do you feel, what I feel
You and I connect
Energy, glowing lights???? revive
Every move, every thought
We will synchronize
Follow my heart beat, hang on to my dream
Hang on to my dream
