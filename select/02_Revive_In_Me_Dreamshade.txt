In front of me, your sedated body,
On your awakening you won't believe your eyes
The trap is ready, the blood will be spread
You are chained to that machine, but is it the same for your life?
The clock has started, its course is irreversible
Now follow the rules;
Live or die: make your choice
The time is ending, be prepared to sacrifice yourself
Use your ability, find the road,
I will award your loyalty
The door is closing, be quick,
Don't waste your time screaming to no one,
This isn't the way
Please revive in me my flames of hope
I've understood my mistakes,
I won't repeat them again
Revive in me
And I finally won the game,
I earned my freedom,
Now all is clear:
There is a reason for this brutality
Now the light of the sun is so brilliant,
Life shines with beauty
